  <h1>Koya Yamamoto</h1>
  
  <p>
    As a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M, Koya Yamamoto combines a passion for cutting-edge research with proven hands-on innovation. His work spans the frontiers of control systems, state estimation, optimal trajectory design, and hardware-software integration—for robots, drones, and spacecraft. With a perfect GPA, advanced coursework, and award-worthy research, Koya has developed high-precision algorithms and embedded flight code that double the speed and accuracy of real-time navigation and optimization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Koya’s journey includes impactful internships—like developing state-of-the-art navigation software at VectorNav and tackling mission-critical dynamics for lunar landers with JAXA. His expertise bridges the gap between theory and application: from pioneering the Complex Step Differentiation method and nonlinear model predictive control to modeling sloshing dynamics and testing solutions on Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is proud to contribute creative ideas, multi-disciplinary skills, and a spirit of global collaboration to the pursuit of autonomy and dynamic control—whether for life-saving logistics, space exploration, or the intelligent machines of tomorrow. Fluent in Japanese, English, and Italian, and always eager for new challenges, Koya is dedicated to advancing the science of motion—for a smarter, more connected world.
