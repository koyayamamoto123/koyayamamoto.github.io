  <h1>Your Name</h1>
  <p>
    Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet!
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m a [Your-City]-based <b>neuroscientist</b> and <b>research software engineer</b> dedicated to developing free, open-source tools for studying brains and the behaviours they produce.
  </p>
  <p>
    I lead the development of movement — a Python package for analysing animal body movements across space and time. As a self-proclaimed <b>brain cartographer</b>, I also harbour a passion for neuroanatomy and contribute to the BrainGlobe project.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m deeply committed to promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science. I find joy in dancing to jazz and folk music.
