    Koya Yamamoto is a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M university under Drs. John Junkins, and Manoranjan Majji. His work spans the frontiers of control systems, state estimation, optimal trajectory design, and hardware-software integrationâ€”for robots, drones, and spacecraft.

    My research as a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering focuses on developing advanced control and state estimation algorithms for autonomous vehicles and spacecraft. 
    I have worked on the Complex Step Differentiation method for efficient sensitivity analysis, nonlinear model predictive control for trajectory tracking under uncertainty, 
    and trajectory optimization using graph coloring techniques. 
    My projects include hardware-in-the-loop testing with platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and applications such as orbit transfer optimization and liquid sloshing dynamics for lunar lander stability. 
    Through these efforts, I aim to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and onboard applicability of control systems and navigation algorithms for real-world engineering challenges.

  <p>
    During my internship at VectorNav, I developed advanced navigation algorithms for inertial measurement units (IMUs), including designing a post-Kalman filter smoothing algorithm that led to a twofold improvement in state estimation accuracy.
    I integrated these solutions with hardware systems, analyzed IMU measurement data, and strengthened my skills in MATLAB, Python, C, and version control systems.
    At JAXA, I researched the dynamics of liquid sloshing during spacecraft lunar landing, created physics-based models using mass-spring-damper systems, conducted simulations to examine vehicle stability and failure modes, and proposed control strategies to prevent lunar lander overturn during touchdown.
